The marketing team is spending way too much time typing in hashtags. Let's help them with our own Hashtag Generator!

Here's the deal:

It must start with a hash symbol (#).
All words must have their first letter capitalized.
If the final result is longer than 140 chars it must return false.
If the input or the result is an empty string it must return false.
For example "hello world"=> "#HelloWorld" "Hi there flex track" => "#HiThereFlexTrack" "" => false "Today we live in a society in which spurious realities are manufactured by the media, by governments, by big corporations, by religious groups, political groups... So I ask, in my writing, What is real? Because unceasingly we are bombarded with pseudo-realities manufactured by very sophisticated people using very sophisticated electronic mechanisms. I do not distrust their motives; I distrust their power. They have a lot of it. And it is an astonishing power: that of creating whole universes, universes of the mind. I ought to know. I do the same thing." => false
